MALWARE I
=========

First home lab assignment

Working environment (for now):
------------------------------
Here are the procedures for setting up quite clean and secure working
environment:
 
 1. Installed TrueCrypt and created encrypted virtual filesystem.
 2. Installed Oracle Virtualbox and addons.
 3. Configured laptop to allow *true* hardware virtualization. On newer
    Thinkpads this is possible through BIOS.
    This should confuse malware as they believe to be working on host system.
  * Set up Openvpn in host and create tunnel to server (won't to this because
    my Openvpn server is a production machine and I don't want it to be DDOSed) 
 4. Set up Lubuntu x64 in Virtualbox.
    I chose Lubuntu because I am quite fluent in Ubuntu but I don't need all the
    junk it installs by default. These are on host. Also, Openbox with LXDE is
    relatively fast and consumes small amount of memory and CPU cycles.
 5. As the default browser on Lubuntu is `chromium` and the Internets thinks that
    it is not secure enough for using with Tor, installed Tor browser bundle.
 6. Started `tor-bundle` with `firefox`.
 7. Profit!

Search results
--------------

Now, we have to find some sites where we could find some interesting results.  
For that:

 1. Search Google for *ddos tor onion* as Tor documentation speaks something
    about The Hidden Network.  
    Google is quite delicate about hacking matters and these sites are probably
    hard to find, so let's turn to *.onion* domain space.
 2. Found [The Hidden Wiki][wiki].
 3. Moved on to [TORDIR][tordir]. There let's choose *Hacking and Related*.
 4. Results:
    * Credit card information from [random][r1]:
       The following PayPal accounts are for sale, email `paypals@tormail.org` for  
       more info.

       $410 USD 10BTC  
       $580 USD 13BTC
    * Banks accounts and DDOS from [CardersPlanet][r2]:
       Bank accounts:  
       Worldwide accounts with balances: 30% from balance.  
       DDOS:  
       Standart host or domain = 100$\day  
       High-risk domain or network (large companies, non-political
       organizations) = 150$\day  
       Political or governmental organization = ask me via TorPM or ICQ.

       Price $20,000
    * [Spammer][spammer]:
        1O BTC = 1,000,000 SUCCESSFULLY SENT EMAILS
    * There was also a site selling SSH access to machines but it is currently down.       
    * DDOSers provide probably spam services also through personal request.
 5. It seems that some of the webpages are down. Trying other means to get the
    result.
    * [Deep Web][dw]:
      - Fun stuff: [He][dangler] steals stuff for you.
    * etc etc. Tor and hidden services are currently way too slow to work with but
    * Hidden Wiki and other directories provide links to all kind of services (file
      sharing, CP, drugs and so on).
